          If you're a developer working for some company, you probably have
          opinions about how your project is being managed. It's natural, we care
          that our projects succeed. I work for the NHS and it matters a lot that
          the work we do is successful - what we do can change people's quality of
          life, it can even save lives. I work on a NHS data system - this system
          is being used right now to test whether drugs are safe and effective.
          <u>My work might be making drugs safer.</u>
        </p>
        <p>
          The success that we want is imperilled when the projects are managed
          badly. You can throw infinite money at people doing IT but if the work
          is done the wrong way, you might as well set that money on fire (see:
          National Programme for IT). Let's fix that by treating IT like a
          factory, and the work we produce just like products going down a
          production line.
        </p>
        <p>
          How is all this relevant? Is this all just an excuse to program a cool
          graphic in JavaScript? The work of writing code is surely very different
          to that of screwing on nuts and bolts to a car. I hope to convince you
          bit by bit that the <b>systematic view</b> that factories use to
          increase throughput is useful in programming as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's start thinking like a factory manager. A factory manager knows
          that:
        </p>
        <!-- Maybe I could make this a regularly changing quote with JS -->
        <blockquote>
          We create something, ~thing, car?~.<br />
          This thing has value, ~money or faster rides to work for customers~.<br />
          This value is created by a <b>process</b>.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          A factory manager dedicates themselves to understanding how the process
          creates the value, and then trying to modify the process to make sure it
          gives the most value. Controversial idea I know.
        </p>
        <p>For us:</p>
        <blockquote>
          We create something, computer programs.<br />
          This thing has value, ~money, lives saved, new research, social
          connections to friends~.<br />
          This value is also created by a <b>process</b>.
        </blockquote>
        <p>Let's start process analysing.</p>
        <h2>Welcome to the factory</h2>
        <!-- Factory simulation here -->
        <!-- Box going through three stations -->
        <p>
          Here's a crude simulation of the process of making something. The
          materials come in from the left, they then go through a series of
          processing steps or <b>workstations</b> and then leave the building to
          be shipped to happy customers on the right.
        </p>
        <p>
          Click the buttons below to add labels to the process to show how it can
          represent different processes.
        </p>
        <!-- Buttons for the labels -->
        <p>
          Each workstation has a few features. It needs a worker to man it, it
          needs materials, it uses some machine. Each workstation can process work
          at a certain speed. Work waiting to be processed sits in a waiting area
          before the workstation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Look at the factory below, in two of the workstations you can add and
          remove processing capacity. Try changing the capacity a bit in the two
          stations and see how it changes the rate of production.
        </p>
      </div>
      <!-- Constrained capacity sim -->
